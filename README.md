#Infraestructure
This repo intends to collect docker-compose files needed to set up the infrastructure needed for other workshops.

I'm not the author of any of this files, just adding here to make it easy to access:

* Pact-broker: Thanks to the pact-foundation =>  https://github.com/pact-foundation/pact-broker-docker/blob/master/docker-compose.yml
* Apache Kafka: https://github.com/confluentinc/cp-all-in-one/blob/6.0.0-post/cp-all-in-one-community/docker-compose.yml
